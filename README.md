# rd-backend

This is the Backend Code for my Chess Variant game.
I use MongoDB to store Games and Users

# Models

  - Games
  - Users

# Future Improvements / Bugs

  most of my attention has been spent focusing on game/gameplay/gameAI.
  Down the road I may add Auth and creating robust persisted Users
  to which I would need to expand on my User API
